Danish daycare policy is driven by the broad public support for women in the labor market. The percentage of Danish women working outside the home is one of the world's highest. About 72 % of Danish women have paid jobs outside the home, which is above the OECD average of 59 %. A history of public investment in both private and public daycare infrastructure ensures that the share of young children in formal daycare is also higher than in other countries. Approximately 4 out of 5 Danish children attend a daycare before the child is 2 years of age.
