For several decades, the city of Copenhagen has been using a simple centralized daycare assignment mechanism, offering parents the freedom to choose from over 300 public daycare centers across the city. 

## Equal access for all citizens

The key access point for daycare applications is the website '[Pladsanvisningen i Københavns Kommune](https://www.kk.dk/borger/pasning-og-skole/pasning-0-6-aar/skriv-op-til-vuggestue-og-dagpleje)' which offers a guide to online applications. The centralized admissions portal administers admissions for public and many private daycare facilities. The centralized admission process ensures equal access to these facilities by following a key design principle.

1. The daycare says **when** it has an open spot 
2) The admissions portal says **who** will take this open spot. 

A private daycare can opt out of the centralized admissions portal and to run their own admission system. In this case, the daycare will typically give consideration over who they think is an ideal match for their daycare services and the parents will typically provide personal information to help the daycare reach a decision for their child.

## A dynamic matching process
Admissions to Copenhagen daycares is a dynamic process, which continuously matches children to daycares. A simple diagram offers a general schematic of the daycare matching process. 

**Figure 1. The daycare matching process**

**Entry into the daycare queuing area**

Public and private daycares have long standing agreements to inform the centralized admissions portal of planned **new openings**. New openings are entered in the **daycare queuing area**.   

**Entry into the child queuing area**

Parents are expected to submit an application for daycare by the time their child is 4 months of age. These **new applications** allow the parent to be waitlisted in the **child queuing area** for a maximum of two daycare institutions of their choice. 

> **Changing an application.** Many parents in the child queuing area exercise an attractive option for a ''guaranteed spot''. If the parent asks for the guaranteed spot option, the parent is allowed to take the guaranteed spot and continue in the child queuing area with the possibility of receiving offers from one of their two daycare waitlists. To learn more, go to the ''ticketing'' section.


**Leaving the daycare and child queuing areas**

The daycares agree to accept any child who is offered a place for these openings. Therefore **matches** are formed when a parent is offered admission and the parent accepts. The acceptance automatically removes a daycare spot from the daycare queuing area. In general, a match also causes the parent to exit the queuing area. The exception is the case of an offer that is granted through the guaranteed spot option. In this case, the parent can remain on the waitlist of one daycare, which is given by their original application. Any parent who does not accept an offer by the time the child is three years of age is automatically withdrawn from queuing area.   

The timely arrival of daycare openings and applications is a key problem that is coordinated by the admissions systems. Timely entry into the queueing areas allows the central admissions system to coordinate the matching of parents to daycares well before the actual date that the child starts daycare. To do this effectively, the system seeks to 1) get children into the queuing area well before the parents need a spot and 2) get planned openings from the daycares well before these spots become vacant. 

## Encouraging timely opening plans from daycares

It is a concern for efficiency that daycares inform the centralized admissions portal of upcoming spots well in advance. An example of an early notice of a daycare opening is the case where the daycare informs the central admission portal in March that a spot is available in September. An example of a late notice of a daycare opening is the case where daycare informs the central admission  portal in August that a spot is available in September

**Figure 2. An early and late notice of a planned opening**

If daycares do not make planned openings known well in advance, it is then difficult to coordinate timely offers to parents, because parents cannot be offered a spot until the centralized admissions portal receives the planned opening from the daycare. 

> **An opportunity for IT?** Many service providers contend with the problem of making available places known well in advance so that users may lock in dates well in advance of when the service is needed. The classic example is a flight ticket model where people book flights before they travel. While airlines may exploit temporary shortages by higher fees, the placement authority seeks to simply gain an accurate forecast of future spots so that a spot can be reserved by a parent. It is worth noting that Copenhagen is improving on this dimension. In the recent past, the system could send offers to parent only a month or two before they would appear. The system is currently able to make offers to parents for spots four or five months before they appear. 

> **A dynamic matching problem.** The problem of getting each daycare to predict when open spots are coming available is a complicating element that is absent in systems that attempts to match all children to all schools at a single point in time. The daycare problem includes the element that the admission system can improve outcomes by forecasting available spots.

## Encouraging timely applications from parents

The general principal of this wait list is **first in first out (FIFO)**, which means that children are prioritized by the age of the application, which is typically reflected by the child's age if the parent makes the application by the 4 month age deadline. 

**Figure 3. Making an application on time**

> If a parent applies late (after 4 months), the parent is assigned the same age priority of a 4-month-old child at the time of the late application. Similarly, if a parent chooses to change a daycare in their list, their child’s age priority at this daycare will be the same age priority of a 4-month-old child at the time of this amendment.


## Creating an offer window for parents

One consideration of a system that is that parents are not burden with offers for start dates that are too early. 


Parents are asked to give a **consideration date**, which is the date that parents wish to entertain start date offers at the daycare of their choice. For example, a parent might state they don't want to receive offers to start daycare when their child is only 8 months of age. Parent's can nevertheless refuse offers (provided they do so in a timely fashion) and maintain their priority on the waitlist. 

**Figure 4. Specifying a consideration date and a withdraw date**

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1ba5787-364e-4959-b3cc-6d32a4130d46" width="600" />


The four month application deadline serves the important purpose of not rushing parents to make applications for daycare immediately after the birth of the child. 

## ''Ticketing'' in the child queuing areas

When a parent enters the queuing area they are assigned **tickets** for the daycares listed in their application (A maximum of two). Parents then wait for a notice from the admission portal to exercise their ticket through an offer, which the parent can choose to accept. A waitlist ticket lists 

1) The daycare's name  
2) The child's name
3) The application/child-age date
4) The parent's choice of a consideration date
5) Sibling priority: sibling versus non-sibling

The parent's application permits the parent to be waitlisted for a **maximum** of two daycares after the child is 4 months of age. 

**Figure 2. Two tickets to daycare**

> Parents can apply to a maximum of two daycares. This is an important limitation that reduces the problem of congestion in the offer process.

> While parents may spend considerable thought over their choice of two daycare waitlists, parents are not asked to **rank** daycares. Therefore, there is no priority by the admissions portal over which waitlisted daycare has an offer sent to a child. In principle a child can be sent two offers simultaneously, and the parent can then decide which offer to accept.

## Exchanging a waitlist ticket for a guaranteed spot ticket

If the parents apply for a guaranteed spot, they exchange one of their tickets for a guaranteed spot ticket that is valid at all daycares in Copenhagen. A guaranteed ticket lists

1) The child's name
2) The application date
3) The personal distance ranking of all daycares

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/274bebb5-9379-4451-b1e8-6bac4c43beda" width="500" />

The personal distance ranking of all daycares in Copenhagen is based on the admission portal calculation of the child's distance to every daycare in the city. The daycares are then ranked for this child by the shortest distance.

**Figure. Calculating the personal distance ranking**

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8220951-8fa9-4644-8268-de30c2df64b8" width="500" />

The distance ranking is used to decide what offer is given to a guaranteed spot application. As with the case of waitlist applicants, daycares have no direct say over which parents have tickets to the offerings in the daycare queueing area. Therefore, information about the daycares is not used to guide the assignment of parents.

## Offer making

The central task of the central admission system is making offers to parents. At the start of each day, each daycare will typically have a number of openings registered on the admissions portal.

**Figure. Unpopular and popular daycares in the daycare queuing area**

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b497a28b-03e3-45d9-9bb9-69072039c540" width="600" />

An outcome of waitlists in this admission system is that spots at some daycares (popular) will be immediately assigned as they become available while other daycares (unpopular) will have multiple spots listed in the daycare queuing area for extended periods of time. 

If any of the current daycare openings are 'desired' by more than one parent, it is assigned according to a simple ticket priority.

**Figure. Ticket priority**


<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c5983f-552b-4dac-8500-9888ed0fb149" width="600" />

An offer is extended to an open spot if there is a relevant waitlisted child with a relevant offer window. After all of these relevant offers are sent, the admissions portal then tries to accommodate the holder of a guaranteed spot ticket by offering the child an unclaimed daycare spot, which is the nearest travel distance to the parent.   

> The possibility to keep the child's position on a daycare waitlist after the parent exercises the guaranteed spot option was created by a change of rules in 2019. Before that date, parents did not have the possibility to maintain their position on either of the two waitlists in their original application. This meant that updated applications were infrequent since application updates created a later admission date which generally worsened the parents standing on daycare waitlists. 

## Accepting an offer

If a waitlisted parent accept an offer, the open spot is removed from the daycare queueing area and the parents waitlist tickets are removed from the child queuing area.

> If parents do not respond to two successive offers, their application is discarded. Parents can always reapply.


If the parent accepts or rejects an offer for a guaranteed spot, the parent continues in the queueing area with the remaining waitlist ticket. 

> The idea is that the parent is compensated for accepting an offer from ''unpopular'' daycares by the option to continue to receive offers from one of the more ''popular'' daycares.
